# NBA-Attendance

This repository contains SQL-based projects that analyze various aspects of NBA game attendance during the 2023-24 season. Below are key insights and findings from the analyses.

**Attendance Trends Over Time**

This analysis identifies periods of higher and lower game attendance throughout the 2023-24 season. By tracking trends, the aim was to understand how attendance fluctuates as the season progresses.

- Average attendance was around 18,000 for most months.
- May and June, during the playoffs, saw the highest average attendance, exceeding 19,000.
- The lowest average attendance was observed in October, at the start of the season.

**Effect of Game Start Time on Attendance**

I explored how game start times influence attendance, comparing afternoon and evening games to determine if timing impacts fan turnout.

- Games starting at 12:30 PM had the highest average attendance, indicating that earlier games may attract more fans.

This project also identified the teams and games with the highest attendance.

- The Chicago Bulls had the highest average attendance across the season, largely due to the franchiseâ€™s Arena United Center, which has the largest capacity.
- The game with the highest attendance was the Chicago Bulls vs. Indiana Pacers on March 27, 2024, at the United Center.
